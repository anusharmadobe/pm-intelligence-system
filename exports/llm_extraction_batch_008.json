He introduced the purpose of the meeting, which was to delve deeper into AI innovations in AM forms, a conversation that started two weeks ago. He highlighted the presence of the product management team and handed over to Anurag to lead the session.\n    ◦ *Team Introduction:* Anurag introduced himself and his colleagues: Vijay, the lead engineering manager for generative AI, Chris, the product manager for other AI aspects, and Satyadeep Maheshwari, the principal engineer for AI-related initiatives. He outlined the session's agenda, which included demos on generative AI for authoring interfaces, multimodal capabilities, and forms optimisation.\n• *Generative AI for Authoring Interfaces:* Anurag demonstrated how generative AI can be used to create forms quickly using screenshots, photos, or simple scribbles, showcasing the ability to detect fields and apply brand templates.\n    ◦ *Form Creation:* Anurag demonstrated the use of generative AI to create forms from various inputs such as screenshots, photos, or scribbles. He showed how a business user could quickly brainstorm and create a form by uploading a photo or screenshot to the generative AI assistant, which then detects fields and generates a form.\n    ◦ *Brand Templates:* Anurag explained that the generative AI assistant allows users to apply brand-specific templates and styles to the generated forms, ensuring consistency with the brand's design guidelines.\n    ◦ *Authoring Assistant:* Anurag showcased another demo where the authoring assistant suggests fields for a form based on a simple command, such as \"create a form with personal information panel.\" The assistant automatically adds the suggested fields to the form, which can then be customized further.\n• *Multimodal Form Filling:* Anurag explained the multimodal capabilities introduced for form filling, including chat-based interactions and document uploads, which enhance the user experience and improve conversion rates.\n    ◦ *Chat-Based Interaction:* Anurag demonstrated how users can interact with forms through a chat-based interface embedded within the form. This chat experience allows users to fill out forms conversationally, making the process more intuitive and user-friendly.\n    ◦ *Document Uploads:* Anurag showed how users can upload identification documents, and the system extracts relevant information to prefill the form fields. This reduces the manual effort required to fill out forms and improves accuracy.\n    ◦ *Field Types:* Anurag highlighted that the chat-based interface supports various field types, including dropdowns, multiple select options, and yes/no questions, making it versatile for different form requirements.\n• *Click to Fill Modality:* Anurag showcased the Click to Fill modality, which allows users to indicate damage on a car image or other visual elements, making form filling more intuitive and reducing errors.\n    ◦ *Damage Indication:* Anurag demonstrated the Click to Fill modality using a car insurance claim form. Users can click on parts of a car image to indicate where the damage occurred and select the damage intensity, which automatically fills the corresponding fields in the form.\n    ◦ *Use Cases:* Anurag mentioned that this modality is useful in various industries, such as dental and aerospace, where users need to indicate specific areas of concern visually. This approach reduces errors and makes the form-filling process more intuitive.\n• *Forms Optimisation:* Anurag discussed the AM sites optimiser product, which identifies opportunities to improve form interfaces, such as reducing the number of fields or improving discoverability, to enhance conversion rates.\n    ◦ *Optimisation Opportunities:* Anurag explained that the AM sites optimiser product analyses forms to identify areas for improvement, such as reducing the number of fields or changing the layout to a progressive disclosure format. These optimisations aim to enhance user experience and increase conversion rates.\n    ◦ *Insight and Suggestions:* Anurag highlighted that the optimiser provides insights and suggestions based on the analysis, such as indicating that a form looks complicated and recommending a more user-friendly layout. The optimiser can automatically create variations of the form for testing and comparison.\n• *Integration with Customer's LLM:* Matthias and Vijay discussed the flexibility of integrating the customer's own LLM, such as Gemini DBLLM, with AM forms, considering the data security and governance requirements.\n    ◦ *LLM Integration:* Matthias raised concerns about data security and governance when using LLMs. Vijay explained that Adobe has a standard agreement with Microsoft for using Azure Open AI models, ensuring that customer data is not used for training. He also mentioned the possibility of integrating the customer's own LLM, such as Gemini DBLLM, with AM forms.\n    ◦ *Data Security:* Vijay assured that the integration with Azure Open AI models ensures data security and that customer data is not used for training the models. He also mentioned that customers could use their own LLMs to maintain control over their data.\n• *Data Extraction from Scanned Forms:* Matthias and Vijay explored the possibility of extracting data from scanned forms and unstructured documents, highlighting the use of adaptive forms and the importance of document quality.\n    ◦ *Data Extraction:* Matthias inquired about extracting data from scanned forms and unstructured documents. Vijay explained that the system could extract data from various document types, including handwritten forms, and convert it into a structured format for further processing.\n    ◦ *Document Quality:* Vijay emphasized the importance of document quality for accurate data extraction. He mentioned that the system performs well with clear and well-defined documents but may face challenges with poor-quality scans or complex handwriting.\n• *Technical Integration and Data Security:* Birgit and Vijay discussed the technical aspects of integrating AM forms with the customer's systems, including data encryption, secure storage, and the use of preprocessor and postprocessor hooks.\n    ◦ *Data Encryption:* Birgit inquired about data encryption during integration. Vijay explained that AM forms support data encryption using preprocessor and postprocessor hooks, allowing customers to implement their encryption methods for secure data transfer.\n    ◦ *Secure Storage:* Vijay mentioned that AM forms do not store user-entered data. Instead, the data is processed in memory and passed directly to the customer's storage endpoint, ensuring data security and compliance with regulations.\n• *Sandbox Environment for POC:* Nitesh and Anurag discussed the availability of a sandbox environment for proof of concept (POC) purposes, with the possibility of enabling generative AI capabilities after accepting a beta agreement.\n• *Next Steps and Follow-up:* Jochen summarised the next steps, including sending out the recording, meeting notes, and coordinating another meeting to discuss migration topics, while ensuring the sandbox environment is ready for use.\n:todo_done: *"}, {"signal_id" : "bee92eec-1e22-4493-bbe6-e88735e18266", "text" : "*\nIt was 1st Kickoff call for VIP but Jet2 decided to move VIP program to Next year Jan.\n\n\nJet2 team shared document during the meeting covering the *expectation and scope of VIP*.\n    ◦ Below is the information shared on the call.

The form is primarily in English, but localisation for dates is being considered for future improvements.\n    ◦ *Form Fields and Data Entry:* The form requires users to enter financial details, including total costs, with calculations such as contingency being automatically computed. Both page one and page two are filled by the form filler before submission, and most fields are static or read-only except for a few, such as currency selection.\n    ◦ *Attachments and Supporting Documents:* Users can attach supporting documents, such as spreadsheets, for estimated costs, but attachments are not mandatory. If required attachments are missing, the next approver (typically an accountant) can deny the submission and request the correct documents.\n    ◦ *Approval Workflow and Approver Selection:* The next approver is selected from a list of all email addresses in Outlook, with rules excluding certain roles (e.g., accountants, senior executives) from being chosen. The workflow enforces multiple approval steps, and the process is designed to prevent direct submission to the President or CEO.\n    ◦ *Form Submission and Status Tracking:* Upon submission, the form follows a defined approval path based on the selected approver and amount thresholds. The system tracks the status of each form, including who approved or denied it, and allows users to print or save the form at various stages.\n• *Requirements for Adobe AEM Forms Migration:* Sakshi, Randy, and the team discussed requirements and expectations for migrating the current form process to Adobe AEM Forms, covering workflow rules, data storage, authentication, and integration points.\n    ◦ *Workflow Rules and Approval Logic:* Approval rules are currently defined within a workflow editor, with each form having its own set of rules based on amount thresholds and organisational roles. The team confirmed that these rules can be authored at the form level in AEM, and dynamic approval paths are required, especially for amended forms.\n    ◦ *Data Storage and Integration:* The current system uses Azure SQL Server for storing approver lists and may use Azure BLOB storage for documents of record. There is no hard requirement to move to Azure SQL, but it is the preferred and available option. SharePoint lists are available but have concerns regarding security and speed.\n    ◦ *Authentication and Access Control:* All forms are behind authentication, with no anonymous access allowed. The team expects AEM to support authenticated workflows, ensuring only authorised users can initiate or approve forms (_*ACL is not a blocker for them - they don't have it today, but want to introduce it*_)\n    ◦ *Document of Record and Error Handling:* The document of record is currently stored as a file, and the team discussed a previous error encountered with document generation. Randy agreed to share error details via Teams for further troubleshooting.\n    ◦ *Session Scheduling and Support:* Sakshi proposed scheduling working sessions to assist with environment setup, document of record configuration, and rapid development environment queries. The team agreed to coordinate sessions around upcoming holidays.\n• *Amendment Process for Approved Forms:* Randy and Sakshi explored the process for amending previously approved forms, including how amendments trigger new approval flows and the technical requirements for handling such scenarios in AEM.\n    ◦ *Amendment Workflow Initiation:* Once a form is fully approved, it can be reopened for amendments, typically to adjust costs due to overruns or changes. Only cost fields can be amended; no new items can be added.\n    ◦ *Prefilling and Approval Path:* The amendment process involves creating a new form prefilled with data from the original, with all other fields set to read-only except those being amended. The approval path may change based on the new total amount or organisational changes.\n    ◦ *Dynamic Approver Selection:* The list of eligible approvers for amendments is dynamically generated based on current organisational roles and amount thresholds, ensuring compliance with updated approval policies.\n    ◦ *Technical Implementation Considerations:* The team discussed whether to treat amendments as new forms with linked historical data, and agreed that AEM should support this approach, allowing for flexible and auditable amendment processes.\n• *Form Field Behaviour and User Experience:* Sakshi and Randy clarified the expected behaviour of various form buttons and fields, including print, save, amend, and reset, as well as localisation and dynamic field display.\n    ◦ *Print and Save Functionality:* The print button is available at all stages and generates a printable version of the form, which may differ from the web version. The save button is primarily for the form filler to save progress locally before submission.\n    ◦ *Dynamic Field Display:* Fields such as contingency, outside labour, and year rows are dynamically displayed based on user input, and the printable version adapts accordingly.\n    ◦ *Reset and Amend Buttons:* The reset button clears the form for the filler, while the amend button is used post-approval to initiate the amendment process. The team agreed to revisit the amend button's implementation in future sessions.\n• *Project Timelines, QA, and Go-Live Process:* Mayank, Sakshi, and Randy discussed project timelines, the QA and UAT process, and the steps required to move the new form to production, confirming that the process is informal and can proceed quickly once development is complete.\n    ◦ *Estimated Timelines:* Randy indicated that the team aims to go live as soon as a working form is ready, ideally before the end of the year, with the process being repeatable for other forms.\n    ◦ *QA and UAT Process:* QA will be performed by Randy, Tim, and George, with UAT handled by accountants and senior managers. The process is expected to take a few weeks at most, with no need for external validation.\n• *Future Scope and Parallel Form Development:* Randy and Sakshi agreed to include an additional European form in the scope, with George providing use case scenarios, and discussed the potential for parallel development to accelerate adoption.\n    ◦ *Parallel Form Implementation:* The team will work on the primary form as the main scope for the VIP engagement, while also preparing to develop a European form in parallel, leveraging the established workflow and technical setup.\n\n:todo_done: *"}, {"signal_id" : "d0a73358-ae47-45b3-805c-bbb73397842c", "text" : "*\nAnurag, Sudhanshu and Khushwant visited the Maruti factory on Friday. We went to the Innovation Gym first where the Adobe team sites (~ 6-8 team members sit in that office). Some quick notes/pointers which can help during the Maruti day on 7th:\n• Main discussion was with Sr VP of Service, Ashok San (they follow the Japanese culture and suffix San when referring to each other).\n• Ashok San is very *data oriented* - most of his queries were around the impact - and how much *quantitative impact* the products were having.\n• When talking about agents - Ashok San was raised queries around *how the specific agent was helping the business*.\n• Ashok's San's mail goal seems to be increasing the outreach to customers - and his point was that - Maruti has data of customers who are coming to their site (*online* and *offline*) - how they could increase this outreach. \n    ◦ Sumit Gupta (Delivery partner) - talked about RTCDP (which has both online and offline data) - and profile stitching - and it could help identify users - once they click on a promotion.\n    ◦ Anurag talked about the fact that with agentic traffic - the content might not be visible to agents - and outreach may be impacted (their main concern was lot of traffic was going to consolidators). They were surprised - were not aware of this, and Anurag proposed we could demo this on Maruti day.\n• Ashok San was surprised why these features/details were not shared with them earlier - and Chinmay or Sumit mentioned that they planned to improve the traffic/site part first, and then move to forms (after reviewing impact). Ashok San highlighted that *in Maruti - we do not do things sequentially, rather in parallel* (for speed).\n• We have Forms opportunity is different areas - including:\n    ◦ Services\n    ◦ TrueValue Dealership (dealership side)\n    ◦ Insurance (on back burner)\n    ◦ Dealer connect\n• Some of these are quite old (~ 10 years), and using old technologies. Some have huge DB with limited resources - and not fix issues (they mentioned - its like fitting 6 airbags in old WagonR).\n• They have MTAB app <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.mtab.android.marutisuzuki&amp;hl=en_IN> (similar exists on Apple - which uses same backend). \n    ◦ App crashes - data loss\n    ◦ No offline option\n    ◦ Integrates with multiple services which they have created in-house (app and services created by their team)\n    ◦ Some of these services allow clicking photo of different car sides - which auto-detects accidental damages - and needed for pick-up and delivery checks.\n• They are very much interested in WhatsApp - and how it could help get confirmation without service centre call - for confirmation on Service Estimates (Maruti leadership wants all communication through a common WABA account)\n• When Anurag was demoing form creation Ashok San asked asked - why we cant create it through a prompt - and Anurag moved to next demo which highlighted the feature (so they are quite interested in Agentic part)\n• The app (which has form with 200+ fields) is updated regularly - 5-10 enhancements in a month - and recent enhancements/changes are related to adding support for Electric cars (changes are done - to be tested/go-live) - but parallel flow is created - and an enhancement takes around a week or two.\n• They asked about how much time it would take - for this 1 time movement to AEM Forms.\n• Current WhatsApp groups used by Maruti service centres are local - and Maruti does not have that info - they want to streamline that - so that Maruti has more details/insights.\n• Ashok San asked - if the Adobe team was aware of the overall flow and stakeholders (not specific to the service flow - but overall - when a car comes to service - then the overall flow between the various stakeholders - customers, dealers, Maruti).\n    ◦ Satyajeet showed how Adobe was working with different team to understand the process - they showed an excel which captures the information they are trying to captures.\n    ◦ We proposed to have another connect if needed post Diwali for getting more insights in the process.\n• Saving time in process is critical for them - they even mentioned that they are working with another company to review the time spent on different steps in the process - from car coming it to exit - to identify areas of improvement.\n:todo_done: *"}, {"signal_id" : "72f2ccec-566d-45d7-809f-e7f5344addf6", "text" : "*\n• *Testing and Validation of Custom Functions for ECID, FCLID, GCLID:* Andy, Mayank, Christy, and the team discussed ongoing testing of custom functions for ECID, FCLID, and GCLID, including the need for development team review and validation of cookie-based retrieval methods, with Shraddha preparing a sample function for ECID and Christy agreeing to verify cookie values in production.\n• *Documentation of Custom Changes and Deployment Processes:* Mayank, Sarah, Andy, and Christy discussed the need for comprehensive documentation of all custom changes, including technical and business details, to facilitate smoother deployments across environments, with Mayank's team agreeing to draft the technical documentation and Christy's team to supplement with environment-specific information.\n• *Multilingual Form Translation and Integration in AEM:* Andy, Sakshi, Christy, Ben, and Mayank discussed the process for translating forms into multiple languages using AEM, including the use of dictionaries, translation providers, and embedding translated forms, with action items to set up Microsoft Translation and share relevant documentation.\n• *Reusable Form Fragments and Authoring Restrictions:* Andy, Sakshi, Mayank, and Sarah discussed strategies for locking down required form fields using fragments or custom components in AEM, aiming for reusability without strict security, and agreed to schedule a demo in the next meeting to illustrate the setup.\n• *Theme Integration for Forms:* Andy and Mayank briefly discussed the need to address theme integration for forms, noting that the current approach uses existing website styling, with plans to involve Ben McKnight and cover this topic in the next meeting.\n:todo_done: *"}]
