To achieve this, we can try the following approaches for authoring XDPs:\n• *Option 1: Script-Based Localization (Single XDP)*\n    ◦ *Approach*: Utilize locale-specific scripts within Designer to dynamically translate labels/captions.\n    ◦ *Advantages*: Maintains a single XDP file, simplifying management.\n    ◦ *Considerations*: This method may lead to a complex and heavy XDP structure, potentially impacting maintainability.\n• *Option 2 (Recommended): Data Binding with Localized XML*\n    ◦ *Approach*: Bind each label/caption to external data sources, similar to field value bindings. Prepare separate `data.xml` files for each locale, containing localized content.\n    ◦ *Advantages*: Cleaner separation of contents, easier to manage and scale across multiple locales.\n    ◦ *Implementation*: As a reference, we can create a sample XDP along with localized data and schema files to demonstrate this approach.\n*Note:* we can discuss these approaches in details.\ncc: <@W4R5LUPK3> <@WQWCBV6NN>"}, {"signal_id" : "4fdcabb5-8e21-4685-8ff1-2df84a5da56a", "text" : "Adding <@WE163TH43> for XFA Translation workflow"}, {"signal_id" : "5155f7c5-0c31-4072-ad05-d721c6eb2911", "text" : "Also, one thing they shared (feedback at end of meeting):\nThe biggest concern part after the meeting was - there is no option for translation in XFA (as they spend a lot of time in XFA authoring).
