Customer came with requirement of *34K fields in a form* (AF1)\n\nMeeting notes:\n• *Migration from Foundation to Core Component Based Forms:* Sakshi and Amit explained the process and results of migrating the large JSON-based foundation component form to a core component based form, highlighting performance improvements, technical changes, and the implications for Vijay and the team.\n    ◦ *Migration Process Overview:* Sakshi described converting the provided JSON foundation component form, which contained approximately 9,100 fields across 9 tables, into a core component based form, and then scaling it up to 37,000 fields to test performance and tab navigation.\n    ◦ *Performance Comparison:* The team observed that while the initial render time for the core component based form was high (around 4 minutes for 37,000 fields), tab navigation was significantly faster compared to the foundation component based form.\n    ◦ *Technical Adjustments:* Due to the lack of a table component in core components, Sakshi explained that tables were represented using panels, and formatting or table-like appearance would need to be achieved through CSS or by developing a custom table component.\n    ◦ *Coexistence of Form Types:* Sakshi clarified that foundation component based forms and core component based forms can coexist within the same AEM infrastructure, and migrating one form does not impact others.\n• *React-Based Headless Form Rendering:* Amit demonstrated rendering the migrated core component form using a React-based headless approach, detailing the technical setup, performance benefits, and deployment considerations for Vijay and the team.\n    ◦ *React Rendering Setup:* Amit showcased the use of a custom React application that fetches JSON from the core component and renders it using a custom hook, with the setup available via code sandbox and downloadable packages.\n    ◦ *Performance Metrics:* Sakshi and Amit reported that the React-based rendering significantly reduced the initial render time to under a minute for 37,000 fields, with tab switching occurring almost instantaneously.\n    ◦ *Deployment and Infrastructure:* Sakshi and Amit explained that deploying the React component requires embedding it within a site page, and that the React-based approach does not require changes to the existing AEM authoring infrastructure, but does require a React client library.\n    ◦ *Compatibility and Feasibility:* The team discussed the need to verify whether React-based rendering is supported on AEM 6.5 or only on cloud setups, with Sakshi taking an action item to confirm this by the end of the day.\n• *Customization, Theming, and Table Representation:* Vijay raised questions about appearance, theming, and table handling in the migrated forms, with Sakshi and Amit clarifying the technical requirements for CSS, JS, and the limitations of core components regarding tables.\n    ◦ *Theming Consistency:* Sakshi and Amit confirmed that core component based forms and vanilla React forms share the same HTML structure, allowing the same CSS themes to be applied to both, provided the official library is used.\n    ◦ *Table Representation:* Sakshi explained that, in the absence of a table component in core components, tables are represented as panels, and achieving a table-like appearance requires custom CSS and potentially additional JavaScript.\n    ◦ *Migration Utility Limitations:* The migration utility provided by the team converts foundation component based forms to core component based forms but does not handle tables perfectly, so manual enhancements or extensions may be necessary.\n• *Performance Metrics and Testing Recommendations:* Service Mothemane and Yashaswi requested detailed performance metrics and scenario-based analysis, with Sakshi recommending that the team conduct their own tests with business rules applied to validate performance improvements.\n    ◦ *Request for Detailed Metrics:* Service Mothemane asked for clear documentation of performance statistics under various scenarios, including the impact of adding business rules, to inform internal stakeholders and guide decision-making.\n    ◦ *Testing with Business Rules:* Sakshi advised that while their tests were conducted with business rules removed, the team should add their own rules to the migrated forms and measure performance in their environment for accurate results.\n    ◦ *Provision of Artifacts:* Sakshi committed to sharing the migrated form packages, documentation, and setup instructions, enabling the team to conduct their own tests and gather metrics.\n• *Alternative Solutions and Parallel Business Discussions:* Takalani, Adele, and Vijay discussed ongoing parallel streams, including meetings with business stakeholders about form splitting and dynamic rendering, with Sakshi providing technical recommendations for these approaches.\n    ◦ *Parallel Business Meetings:* Takalani confirmed a scheduled meeting with business stakeholders to discuss alternative solutions, and Adele clarified that this stream is independent of the technical migration efforts.\n    ◦ *Dynamic Form Rendering:* Vijay described exploring dynamic rendering based on user sector classification, and Sakshi suggested splitting the form into smaller fragments or using conditional rendering to improve performance

process from legacy XFT forms to adaptive forms for the State of Washington project, detailing the technical workflow, challenges, and the use of custom utilities and scripts.\n• *Legacy System Overview:* Paul explained that the original system consisted of approximately 300 XFT forms created in a VB application called Forms Gen, which interacted with various backend systems and produced both input and output forms, with output forms being archived and printed for different outlets.\n• *Migration Workflow and Tools:* The migration involves parsing XFT files using a custom Python script to extract fields, properties, and embedded VBScript logic, which are then compiled into a specification spreadsheet that forms the basis for adaptive form development.\n• *Reusable Components and Theming:* Paul described the creation of reusable fragments for common elements such as names and addresses, the development of a common theme and template, and the use of client libraries and custom layouts to standardize and streamline adaptive form creation.\n• *Output Form Generation and Packaging:* The process includes assembling document packages by combining adaptive forms with output templates (XDPs), leveraging assembler APIs, and integrating third-party libraries for PDF handling and redaction, with the final packages distributed or archived as required.\n• *Specification and QA Process:* A detailed specification document is generated for each form, reviewed and approved by the client, and used as a reference for both development and QA, ensuring alignment and traceability throughout the migration.\n• *Project Scale, Timelines, and Resource Allocation:* Vijay Kumar and Sudhanshu inquired about the overall scale, batch processing, and time estimates for form migration, with Paul clarifying the number of forms, batching strategy, and the breakdown of effort between adaptive and output forms.\n• *Form Volume and Batching:* Paul stated that the project involves migrating approximately 300 input forms and 800 output forms, with work proceeding in batches of five to ten forms at a time, and the current contract targeting around 100 adaptive forms.\n• *Time Estimates and Workflow:* The typical timeline for creating an adaptive form is two to four weeks, depending on complexity, with the process including specification generation, client review, and development, while output templates are generally simpler and can be created in a day.\n• *Effort Distribution:* Paul explained that adaptive form development usually takes one to five weeks per form for a developer, while output template creation is much faster due to their static and repetitive nature, and that work on output forms can begin in parallel with adaptive form specification review.\n• *Reuse and Efficiency Gains:* The team leverages existing forms and fragments to accelerate development, often modifying similar forms rather than starting from scratch, which reduces effort and increases velocity as the project progresses.\n• *Automation, Utilities, and AI Opportunities:* Satya Deep and Sudhanshu discussed with Paul the evolution of migration utilities, the potential for cumulative improvements, and the possible application of AI to further streamline specification generation and logic extraction.\n• *Utility Evolution and Pattern Matching:* Paul described how the custom Python script and associated Excel-based dictionary are incrementally improved by capturing and reusing common code patterns and logic, making the specification process more efficient over time.\n• *Challenges with Legacy Code:* Despite automation efforts, significant variation in legacy VBScript and form logic limits the extent of automation, requiring manual review and interpretation, especially for unique or complex cases.\n• *Potential AI Applications:* Paul and Satya Deep discussed the potential for AI to assist in interpreting legacy VBScript, generating specifications, and identifying reusable components, with the goal of reducing manual effort and accelerating the migration process.\n• *Future Collaboration and Demonstrations:* Vijay Kumar proposed a follow-up session to demonstrate current AI agent capabilities for form authoring and to review a sample migrated form, aiming to identify areas where AI can further optimize the workflow.\n• *Technical Architecture and Integration Details:* Paul outlined the technical architecture supporting the migration, including the use of Spring Boot applications, REST APIs, assembler calls, and integration with backend systems, as well as the project’s deployment and tracking infrastructure.\n• *Forms Gen Server and API Integration:* Form submission data is sent as JSON to a Spring Boot-based Forms Gen Server, which interfaces with Adobe APIs via a partner-provided REST layer, orchestrates PDF generation, and assembles document packages for distribution or archival.\n• *Project Management and Tracking:* The team uses two Jira systems—one internal and one customer-facing—for tracking development tasks and QA findings, with the project built using Maven, VS Code, and GitHub for version control and deployment.\n• *Next Steps and Collaboration Planning:* The group agreed on next steps, including sharing specification documents and form packages, arranging access to development environments, and scheduling a follow-up meeting to demonstrate and compare form authoring approaches.\n• *Sharing Artifacts and Access:* Paul committed to sharing a sample specification document and, if possible, providing access to a development environment or project package for Vijay Kumar, Sudhanshu, and Satya Deep to review.\n• *Follow-Up Meeting Objectives:* The next meeting will focus on demonstrating current AI agent capabilities, reviewing a sample migrated form, and discussing technical and process details to identify further opportunities for collaboration and optimization.\n\n:todo_done: *"}]
