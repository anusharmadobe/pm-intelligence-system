But most of these forms were Reader Extended and then filled/submitted offline or through email.\n• We want to evaluate GenAI based form conversion for some of their form. In the meeting we discussed evaluating their 433-A (OIC) form (shared with <@W4RU708G5> offline) to see if this would have a better conversion with AFCS.\n• We need to confirm if they need DoR - since that would require binding to XFA elements as well - FYI <@W4RU708G5>.\n• Will be creating an internal slack channel for IRS to speed up communication. Also, <@W011G64JM5W> would be evaluating the Gen AI based form conversion on his environment (will be sharing the program/environment details).\ncc: <@W4RSW3ECC> <@W5HEU5M7Y>\n:todo_done: *"}, {"signal_id" : "a8996547-917b-40bf-9fee-45f13e0e4673", "text" : "*\n• The meeting was held to address the issue(<https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/LC-3922633>)  raised by Four Solutions Partner on behalf of Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo was not aware of this and wanted a demo of the issue and how we are planning to fix it. \n• The problem involves text boxes and text fields being read by screen readers even when the \"speak disable\" property is set to 1 in the template file.\n• We provided a demo of the issue and explained how to resolve it by making changes to the XCI and XDP files.\n• We walked through the process of marking a draw field in the template as an artifact, ensuring that \"speak disable\" is set to 1, preventing it from being read by the screen reader, and ensuring no tag is created.\n• We clarified the use of the \"taggingMode\" field in the XCI, which should be set to \"custom mode\" to make text fields uneditable, along with setting \"speak disable\" to 1.\n• The customer was satisfied with the solution, understanding that the issue can be fixed by updating the XCI and configuring the correct properties in Designer.\n• They expressed appreciation for the support we are providing in addressing accessibility issues in Designer and XMLFM.\n:todo_done: *"}, {"signal_id" : "d2b2508f-a331-4e7c-a9c0-106bbdc112bd", "text" : "*\n*Discussion Summary*\n\n*IC Editor Issue:* \nAs of now we don't have any open issue with Editor .\n• MasterPage Option: The MasterPage option in the editor is causing confusion for customers.

They discussed the progress and empowerment provided by the product, which was appreciated by the higher levels.\n• *Adaptive Forms Versioning:* Emanuele is working on custom versioning logic for adaptive forms, including both fragments and forms. Once an adaptive form is published, it will be saved into a backup folder with its timestamp and embedded fragments.\n*INPS*\n• *Batch Processing Implementation:* Emanuele shared that the team is implementing the C# code for batch processing and optimizing the loading process of XML files into Azure storage. They are handling batches directly from the C# code and are upset about the missing functionality to rotate files.\n• *Performance Testing:* Emanuele reported that they ran a test with 100K samples to test performance, but half of them failed, and the failure folder was removed by the customer. They plan to start a new test once the code is ready.\n• INAIL is not happy with batch not supporting multiple operations on a PDF. \n:todo_done: *"}]
