# Chat Batch Export

1) Open a batch prompt file in `prompts/` and copy it into Cursor Chat.
2) Attach the matching batch JSON from `batches/`.
3) Ask Cursor to respond with strict JSON only.

After each batch, save the JSON response (e.g., `batch_001_output.json`).
You can later merge all batch outputs manually or with a script.
