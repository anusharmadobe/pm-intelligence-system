   <@W010NNJV7S8> How are we ensuring <@U08HVLWG1UM> has visibility into upcoming monthly features and docs are planned for them in due time? Do we provide docs same time as feature is released or later (how much time)?

   Hi team,
I just received an email saying I won $20 gift card in a lucky draw at the Community Fair. :slightly_smiling_face:
 Hope it’s not a spam email!
This is the first time I’ve ever won a lucky draw :blush:.

   Hi team,
 I also created a website using Lovable. It's a simple, UI-focused site that explains the importance of having a unified Table of Contents for the Rule Editor.
Published site link: <https://lovable-rule-explorer-edit.lovable.app/>
I still need to do hands-on on Cursor.
Thanks to <@WAM5KDYBZ> and <@W4R4S9FS4> sir for the motivation and the required help. :slightly_smiling_face:

*PS* - I did this on my way to airport. #productivityInBLRTraffic
Thanks to the session which gave me the confidence that it can be achiev...
