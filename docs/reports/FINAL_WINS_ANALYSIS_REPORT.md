## ⚠️ WINS THAT NEED MORE CONTEXT

These mention customers but lack quantifiable impact:

1. **Chris J - NFCU conversations** - Customer engagement, but what was the outcome?
2. **Chris J - Deutsche Bank pitch** - Sales activity, but was it won?

**Recommendation:** Follow up to get:
- Did NFCU requirements lead to prioritization changes?
- Did Deutsche Bank become a customer?
- What was the quantifiable impact?

- **Real High-Confidence Wins:** 1

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Encourage team to include in status updates:**
   - Customer names when relevant
   - Quantifiable metrics (numbers, percentages, counts)
   - Completion language ("delivered", "unblocked", "enabled") not just "working on"

2. **Focus on outcomes, not activities:**
   - ✅ "Delivered X to Customer Y"
   - ✅ "Unblocked Customer Z by..."
   - ❌ "Working on X for Customer Y"
   - ❌ "Preparing proposal for Customer Z"

3. **For manager reporting, prioritize:**
   - Customer enrollments/deals
   - Customer unblocks with specific deliverables
   - Quantifiable deliverables (articles, features, etc.)
   - Industry-first achievements

4. **Consider following up on:**
   - Customer conversations that may have led to wins
   - Sales pitches that may have closed
   - Work-in-progress items that may have completed
