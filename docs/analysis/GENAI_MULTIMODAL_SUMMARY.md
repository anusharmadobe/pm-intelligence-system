## Current Workarounds

### For Design Analysis
- ✅ **Hybrid Approach:** AI describes, humans evaluate strategically
- ✅ **Structured Frameworks:** Use design evaluation frameworks with AI
- **Effectiveness:** MEDIUM (works but doesn't solve strategic gaps)

### For Video Analysis
- ✅ **Transcription + Manual:** AI transcribes, humans analyze
