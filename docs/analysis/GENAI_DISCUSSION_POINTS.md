- **Rule:** All judgments and decisions require explicit human approval
- **Implementation:**
  - Judgments cannot be created without `userId` parameter
  - Artifacts require human review before publication
  - No autonomous decision-making endpoints
  - All GenAI outputs marked as "draft" until approved
- **Rationale:** GenAI amplifies human judgment; it does not replace it
- **Enforcement:** System-level checks; API validation
- **Example:** PM Intelligence System requires `userId` for all judgment creation

#### **Immutable Signal Layer**
- **Rule:** Signals are never modified or summarized; they remain raw and traceable
- **Implementation:**
  - Signals table is append-only
  - No LLM processing at signal layer
  - All summaries/insights live in judgments layer
  - Signal content cannot be edited after ingestion
- **Rationale:** Preserves data integrity; enables auditability
- **Enforcement:** Database constraints; code-level checks
- **Example:** Slack messages stored as-is; synthesis happens in judgments

#### **Append-Only Judgments**
- **Rule:** Judgments are never overwritten; new judgments append to history
