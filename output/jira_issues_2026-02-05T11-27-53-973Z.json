This feature is crucial for teams that work with structured data and need to integrate JSON seamlessly into their workflows. Currently, the lack of JSON support is a significant limitation, as noted in multiple feedback signals.\n\n### What customers need\n\nCustomers need the ability to input data in JSON format within forms. This will streamline their data handling processes, making it easier to manage and transform data as needed. The feature should support JSON both for templates and data files, as indicated by customer queries.\n\n### Sample Signals\n- \"Thanks for sharing this. The use case shared was JSON format for data input. We along with another team can have a discussion on this and see if it fits the use case...\"\n- \"Is the JSON support in the Output service intended for templates or for data files? During a recent hackathon, we worked on enabling this...\"\n- \"Yes, data in JSON format...\"\n- \"When you say JSON, do you mean data in JSON format only? The case which Aditya described. Please confirm...\"\n- \"So basically, just a JSON -> XML transformer insertion at a suitable point in the execution path?\"\n\n---\n\n## Customer Evidence\n- **Affected Customers**: Various\n- **Total Signals**: 6\n- **Signal Types**: feedback\n\n## Scoring\n\n- **Impact Score**: 15/100\n- **Confidence Score**: 100/100\n- **Urgency Score**: 30/100\n\n\n## Technical Notes\nConsider existing data input validation mechanisms and how they can be extended to support JSON. Verify compatibility with current data processing workflows and identify any necessary adjustments. Ensure robust error handling for malformed JSON data.\n\n---\n*Generated from opportunity: 5eb4e281-0ab5-4a99-a14b-248ca3d2f931*\n"

This feature will primarily benefit customers like GM Financial and Toyota Financial Services, who have expressed the need for more robust data integration within their forms. \n\n## Why This Matters\n\nCurrently, the IC Editor lacks the ability to bind form inputs directly to data models, which limits its functionality for customers who require dynamic data handling. This enhancement will streamline workflows and improve data accuracy by allowing users to directly integrate their forms with backend data sources.\n\n## Customer Signals\n- **GM Financial** (2025-08-07): Feedback on the need for improved data binding in forms.\n- **GM Financial** (2025-07-23): Feature request for more robust data integration in IC Editor Forms.\n- **Toyota Financial Services** (2025-05-15): General feedback on limitations in form data handling.\n- **GM Financial** (2025-04-03): Feedback regarding the need for dynamic data capabilities in forms.\n\n---\n\n## Customer Evidence\n- **Affected Customers**: GM Financial*, Toyota Financial Services*\n- **Total Signals**: 4\n- **Signal Types**: feedback, feature_request\n\n## Scoring\n\n- **Impact Score**: 13/100\n- **Confidence Score**: 100/100\n- **Urgency Score**: 30/100\n\n\n## Technical Notes\nConsider potential impacts on existing form workflows. Ensure that data binding operations do not degrade performance. Dependencies might include updates to the backend data handling services and potential changes to the IC Editor's user interface.\n\n---\n*Generated from opportunity: 2c08b6d1-150f-4c7f-9b60-e7e043ea14d0*\n"
