They are using XDP Forms and want to migrate to HTML5 Forms.\n• They are on-prem - 6.5.22\n• 800-900 forms\n• Font issue - is currently a blocker: <https://aemcs-workspace.adobe.com/bot/conversation/fd1a2149-f976-41e0-b135-8bbba0ebc139|E-001631249>\n• *HTML Extension for Caching:* Sudhanshu, Devendra, and Abhishek Kolluru discussed the recent change to cache HTML (.html extension is not coming on 6.5 and was added recently on 6.5) on the cloud service and the possibility of backporting this enhancement. Abhishek emphasized the importance of this feature for their large number of forms and server capacity. <@W6CBB4953> they mentioned about caching implemented and then removed (from last meeting discussion) - due to some issues on mobile - could you provide more details.\n• *Embedding HTML Forms:* Devendra demonstrated how to embed HTML forms in external sites using an iframe and dispatcher settings. Sudhanshu clarified that this method can be applied to any external site.\n• *Static vs Dynamic HTML Forms:* Abhishek Kolluru and Sudhanshu discussed the caching of static HTML forms and the challenges with dynamic forms. Abhishek highlighted the importance of not caching forms with query parameters and the need for static forms to be cached.\n• *Font Issue on Mac:* Abhishek Kolluru raised a font issue with HTML5 forms on Mac, which works fine on Windows. Devendra suggested creating a custom CSS profile to address the issue. Sudhanshu requested the support ticket ID to review and confirm the issue.\n• *JSON Payload for Prefilled Forms:* Abhishek Kolluru explained their process of using JSON payloads to prefill forms and the challenges faced with CSS and JS references in the HTML forms (_currently relative path - need absolute path_). Sudhanshu noted the need to identify and document the steps to address this issue.\n\n:todo_done: *Next Action*\n• H*TML Caching Support:* Introduce support for caching HTML5 forms and evaluate the client-side data merge requirement. (<@WQ6GEBZHN>)\n• *Font Issue on Mac:* Review the support ticket related to the font issue on Mac and share the documented steps to resolve it. (<@WQ6GEBZHN>)\n• *Dispatcher Extension Validation:* Validate the HTML extension for caching on a local dev environment before providing it for use. (<@WQ6GEBZHN>)\n• *CSS and JS References in HTML Forms:* Share documented steps on how to provide CSS and JS references in HTML forms through dispatcher settings. Also check Sling mapping - need to make relative path to absolute path (<@WQ6GEBZHN> - cc: <@U02RMEY3D1C>)\n• HTML returned for first page - need complete pages - they have to scroll manually (need an option to avoid that) - <@WQ6GEBZHN> I believe we do this for test profile.

They have XDP forms which are present as links in mutliple websites. The customers fill those forms , print it and post it. They want to digitalize this use case using HTML5 Forms and have some questions around that. During the summit they clearly mentioned they are not planning to move to Adaptive Form currently.\n\nThe team has shared the questions earlier in the mail and we had a discussion around the same.\n\nTheir current architecture that they have tried is that they have a custom servlet which forwards the request to the HTML5 Form rendition and returns that. Then they have an external website which either embeds the Form as iframe or redirects to the AEM Servlet which forwards to the HTML5 Form rendition profile.\n\n1. They wanted a validation of the above strategy and if possible to hide certain parameters from the request. _*Advised them to have sling mapping or some selector based notion to identify the xdp path in their servlet.*_\n2. They have another use case (non iframe), where they want to fetch the HTML from an application or a web app and then insert the HTML in that page. This is also possible with the way we do it for Adaptive Forms, but we need to implement it for HTML5 Forms as well. _*They have asked for a sample if possible.*_ \n3. They currently use an http url to fetch the data but want to hide that url. _*Advised them to provide a prefill service that can take an id and then use that service to fetch the data. Clearly mentioned that we do not store any data in AEM to ease out their security concerns.*_ \n4. They want to cache the HTML content in dispatcher. _*Mentioned that it needs to be supported on 6.5 and they need to raise a new Feature Request for the same.*_\n5. Discussed with them how complex their xdps are and they mentioned they only have some validation rules in the xdps.\n6. Arun asked about cloud migration and they asked for a write up from us on what are the differences between the on-prem version vs Cloud so that they can get a buy in from the higher management\n\n:todo_done: *Next Action*\n• Providing examples of embedding forms in external websites with or without iframes. *- Adobe*\n• Sharing documents on HTML5 forms and PDF forms differences *- Adobe*\n• Sharing ETA on how the dispatcher cache can be enabled on-prem *- Adobe*\n• Share documentation and talking points on the benefits of migrating to the cloud for AEM forms *- Adobe*\n• They will raise a enhancement request for enabling the support of dispatcher cache in HTML5 Forms. *- Customer*",

          "content": "Hello!\n\nIt sounds like there were a couple of open questions about the AI Assistant’s ability to handle custom components and queries about external integrations:\n\n• *Custom Components Support:* As noted in a similar engagement (see “Spark NZ – GenAI Assistant Demo (27 Mar 2025)”), customers have asked for ways to incorporate their own custom components into the Assistant’s generated forms or rules. Currently, this is under internal discussion — the short-term approach would be to manually integrate your custom components, while Adobe product teams consider a more streamlined “plug-in” method. So yes, it’s possible, but it may require additional configuration or code referencing in your environment.\n\n• *Integration with External Sources:* The Assistant can suggest or scaffold certain connections (for example, calling a REST endpoint in a form rule). However, in most cases you still have to define the actual endpoint, authentication, and data structure. The AI Assistant can help give you a starting point, but to finalize the integration, you’ll often need to specify details of your external service.\n\nRegarding *increasing conversion rates* for lead-generation forms, the “Success Studio” approach can be very helpful, as it focuses on iterative improvements to the form experience. That, coupled with thorough versioning (which can be done natively in AEM Forms), may help you track and optimize changes.\n\nIf you have more details about your custom components or the desired integrations, feel free to share! We can also set up a session to walk through the versioning capabilities and how to pull in analytics for form conversion improvements.\n\n_Mr. FluffyJaws_ _Disclaimer: If my answer wasn't helpful, please feel free to ignore it.

We confirmed that it is done during experimentation but generally it is 1% of all site visits\n\n*Opportunities*\nThey wanted to look at the examples of different type of opportunities and we shared with them the drop off analysis and Form Navigation.\nThe Form Navigation Opportunities made total sense to them while it was mentioned that suggestions for the drop off hypothesis has to be proven by an experiment.\n\n*Business KPIs*\nThe team shared the details of the KPIs they currently monitor via an agency which includes navigations within the site pages, field drop offs, conversion rate.\nThey are also interested in time taken to fill a form which they are not able to measure currently\n\n*Integration during development cycle*\nAs they are in the process of modernizing their forms, they wanted to identify certain opportunities before going live as well. They wanted to understand if the tooling can integrate during the development phase (figma designs etc) as they have a huge development process (business justification, processes etc) if something needs to be changed on prod.\n\nWe mentioned that we would be creating a knowledge base once we have proven hypothesis and use that to suggest best practices or common pitfalls during the design phase as well.\n\n*Next Steps*\nThe team liked the idea and wanted to try it out on their environment. We need to enable the FT on their environment. They are also in talks to get a trial version of Sites Optimizer.\n:todo_done: *Next Action*\n",

From what I understand, when they initially asked about it, <@W5HEU5M7Y> had mentioned that It is meant for Adaptive Forms (AF), not XDPs. However, the customer is still interested in trying it out.\n\nI connected within team to get more details on it and get to know that this feature is not in EA (Early Access) yet. Given that the feature is not officially in EA and currently doesn't align with the customer’s intended use (for XDPs),\n\nCould you please advise if it's possible to enable it on the customer's environment so that they can try it out?\n\ncc: <@W9QMZFR39> <@W4RSW3ECC>",
