Shivendra mentioned that it is good that Form Opportunities are also presented within a single tool. They were earlier confused with what Forms is doing vs Sites.\n\n*Sampling in Optel*\nWe emphasised that the analysis and opportunity suggestion is AI driven but since they had low traffic it takes time to collect enough data. There was a question if we can change the sampling rate. We confirmed that it is done during experimentation but generally it is 1% of all site visits\n\n*Opportunities*\nThey wanted to look at the examples of different type of opportunities and we shared with them the drop off analysis and Form Navigation.\nThe Form Navigation Opportunities made total sense to them while it was mentioned that suggestions for the drop off hypothesis has to be proven by an experiment.\n\n*Business KPIs*\nThe team shared the details of the KPIs they currently monitor via an agency which includes navigations within the site pages, field drop offs, conversion rate.\nThey are also interested in time taken to fill a form which they are not able to measure currently\n\n*Integration during development cycle*\nAs they are in the process of modernizing their forms, they wanted to identify certain opportunities before going live as well. They wanted to understand if the tooling can integrate during the development phase (figma designs etc) as they have a huge development process (business justification, processes etc) if something needs to be changed on prod.\n\nWe mentioned that we would be creating a knowledge base once we have proven hypothesis and use that to suggest best practices or common pitfalls during the design phase as well.\n\n*Next Steps*\nThe team liked the idea and wanted to try it out on their environment. We need to enable the FT on their environment. They are also in talks to get a trial version of Sites Optimizer.\n:todo_done: *Next Action*\n",

Though shredit has a similar form across all the pages, Stericycle has different measure for different forms.\n\nThey measure CPL from the paid traffic and Colin will supply current *cost-per-lead (CPL)* figures for paid traffic in a follow-up note.\n\n*Experimentation Framework:* Vijay cleared the doubts regarding licensing and availability of experimentation framework in their environment\n\n*Access to Site Optimizer:* Colin  inquired about access to the Site Optimizer, explained that portal access with only Form specific Opportunities is forthcoming; meanwhile, form-specific insights will be shared as documents.\n\nNext Steps:\n\n*Share the Data for Review:* (Colin)\nThey will review the form optimization insights and discuss with the sales team or senior leaders to determine the feasibility of implementing the suggested changes.\n\n*VIP Program Participation:* They will Discuss internally and confirm participation in the VIP program for form optimization testing.\n\n*Follow-up Meeting:* Schedule a follow-up meeting for the week of July 28th to discuss the form optimisation opportunities and next steps.\n\n*Document Authoring (Separate topic than Forms Optimizer)*\nVijay and Colin discussed Document Authoring (Dark Alley) and how they can leverage it for Forms.

They aim to reduce the manual effort needed after form conversion.\n• *Binder and Dor Binder Requirement:* Satya Deep mentioned that the team is working on a PR to implement changes for the binder and door binder requirement. They need input from Naveen's team to understand what should be populated into the attribute groups.\n• *Adobe AI Capabilities:* Naveen inquired about leveraging Adobe AI capabilities, and Satya Deep confirmed that it is enabled and can be tried out. However, some manual intervention may be required to make the forms fully functional.\n• *Guide Bridge Change:* Satya Deep mentioned an open item related to the guide bridge, which has been merged and is available for use.\n• *Forms Conversion Demonstration:* Mayank demonstrated the conversion of forms, highlighting that 15 out of 19 forms were converted successfully. The remaining forms were too large and require the implementation of async functionality.\n• *Dark Theme Issue:* Mayank addressed the dark theme issue, explaining that the theme depends on the system settings. If the system is set to dark mode, the form will appear in dark mode.\n• *Form Conversion Flakiness:* Satya Deep and Mayank discussed the flakiness in form conversion, noting that retrying the conversion process usually resolves the issue.\n• *Adobe Sign Integration:* Naveen confirmed that the forms will use Adobe Sign for e-signatures. The user will fill out the form in HTML, and the form will be sent for e-signature using Adobe's API.\n• *Manual Effort in Form Conversion:* Raciel and Mayank discussed the manual effort required to delete repeated fields like account numbers. They suggested providing guidance during the import process to avoid manual deletion.\n• *Repeatable Panels Limitation:* Mayank mentioned a limitation in converting repeatable panels, where the same rows are converted multiple times instead of being implemented as repeatable panels.\n• *Multisigners Issue:* Mayank reported an issue with multisigners, which is being investigated by the internal team.

Make sure to check for accuracy._\n*Key Topics:*\n• *Introduction:* Arun, Kathy Behler, Jennifer Wroblewski, Shami, Vijay Kumar, and Christina Trujillo discussed the use of Forms in AEM, Marketo, and RTCDP. The meeting aimed to understand the use cases, discuss recent innovations, and explain how the connectors work. \n• *Current Forms Setup:* Jennifer Wroblewski and Shami explained that their forms are currently built in Marketo and embedded into site pages using HTML. They aim to centralise forms management in AEM while retaining backend automation through Marketo. \n• *Marketo Connector:* Arun explained the functionality of the Marketo connector, which allows easy mapping of existing Marketo forms onto AEM forms and introduces a new trigger specific to AEM form submissions. This enables the reuse of smart campaigns and activities built in Marketo. \n• *Forms Migration:* Jennifer Wroblewski mentioned that they have more than 50 forms to migrate from Marketo to AEM. Arun inquired about the reusability of form fragments and the scale of the migration. \n• *Edge Delivery Services:* Shami confirmed that their current forms are cloud-based, but they are considering using edge delivery services for other projects. Arun highlighted that Forms are supported on Edge delivery services and can be built using the Universal Editor. \n• *AAP Connector:* Arun described the AAP connector, which allows form data to be submitted into an XDM-based schema in RTCDP. This data can then be used for personalising journeys and segmenting users into audiences for downstream use in AAP apps. \n• *Form Experience Builder:* Arun and Vijay Kumar introduced the Form Experience Builder, which uses Gen. AI to create forms quickly by interpreting screenshots or hand-drawn images. This tool aims to ease the form creation process and help scale the migration of forms. \n• *Next Steps:* Arun and Vijay Kumar discussed the next steps, including enabling the connectors and innovations on Lumens instances, sharing documentation, and scheduling a follow-up meeting to focus on the Marketo part and the migration process. \n:todo_done: *Next Action*\n*Marketo Connector:*\n• Share documentation on setting up the connection between AEM Forms and Marketo, including the required credentials. (Arun, Vijay Kumar) \n*Form Experience Builder:*\n• Send the beta agreement for the Form Experience Builder to Christina Trujillo for review and approval. (Vijay Kumar) \n• Schedule a follow-up meeting towards the end of next week to focus on the Marketo part and the migration process.
