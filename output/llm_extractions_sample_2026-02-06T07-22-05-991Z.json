Performance is critical and open to evaluate React based rendition on a React page as well. Were happy to know about Review component, and Table not as critical as Review - and currently PDF forms used for Review as well. Interested in *Success Studio*, and *GenAI* capabilities (though I highlighted that some of the new innovations could not be available on on-prem). They want *JSON support in Designer*!\n*Participants from IRS side:* *Vara Prasada Rao Ande* (Publishing Program Specialist, Digital Mobile &amp; Adaptive Forms), *Terry James P* (Form Specialist - most probably.. He is working on one of the complex forms)*, Manno Steven R* (IRS leadership)\n\n• *Adobe Support Call:* Ande explained the purpose of the call, which is to discuss Adobe tickets and seek help from the Adobe Engineering team to convert existing adaptive forms to foundational components using a utility tool.\n    ◦ *Purpose of Call:* Ande explained that the call was initiated to discuss Adobe tickets and seek assistance from the Adobe Engineering team to convert existing adaptive forms to foundational components using a utility tool. The goal is to reduce the effort required for the conversion and implement best practices suggested by the Adobe team.\n    ◦ *Adobe Tickets:* Ande mentioned that several Adobe tickets were submitted, and the Adobe Support team recommended a call with the Adobe Engineering team to discuss tools and utilities for converting existing adaptive forms to foundational components.\n    ◦ *Utility Tool:* Ande highlighted the utility tool provided by Adobe, which can help automatically convert foundational component forms into core component forms, reducing the manual effort involved in the conversion process.\n    ◦ *Support and Best Practices:* The intention of the call is to get support from the Adobe Engineering team to reduce project effort and implement best practices for the conversion process.\n• *Migration Tool Demo:* Sudhanshu mentioned that they do not have the migration tool handy but can schedule a subsequent call to demo the tool and explain its support for migration.\n    ◦ *Tool Availability:* Sudhanshu stated that the migration tool is not currently available for demonstration but offered to schedule a subsequent call to demo the tool and explain its support for migration.\n    ◦ *Migration Support:* Sudhanshu explained that the migration tool supports the migration of the structure, easing the migration effort by providing initial content that can be modified for business logic.\n• *Current vs. Future Development:* Ande presented the current and future development process for adaptive forms, highlighting the challenges with core components and the decision to leverage the latest features of core components.\n    ◦ *Current Development:* Ande described the current development process, which involves creating adaptive forms using foundational components and XML schema for form submission.\n    ◦ *Future Development:* Ande outlined the future development process, which aims to use core components and JSON schema for form submission to leverage the latest features and improve performance.\n    ◦ *Challenges:* Ande highlighted the challenges faced with core components, including the lack of support for XML schema and the need to create both JSON and XML schemas, which adds complexity and effort to the development process.\n    ◦ *Decision to Leverage Core Components:* The decision to leverage core components was made to take advantage of the latest features and recommendations from Adobe, despite the challenges involved in the transition.\n• *Form Submission Formats:* Sudhanshu and Ande discussed the use of JSON and XML formats for form submission, with Sudhanshu recommending JSON for better performance and reduced dependencies.\n    ◦ *JSON vs. XML:* Sudhanshu recommended using JSON for form submission due to its better performance and reduced dependencies compared to XML.\n    ◦ *Current Use of XML:* Ande explained that the current process involves using XML schema for form submission, but they have recently started using JSON for new requirements from external systems.\n    ◦ *Performance Benefits:* Sudhanshu highlighted the performance benefits of using JSON, including improved client-side performance and reduced dependencies on third-party libraries like jQuery.\n    ◦ *Future Development with JSON:* Ande expressed the need for Adobe Engineering team support to enable JSON schema binding in the designer level to avoid the additional effort of maintaining both JSON and XML schemas.\n• *Large Forms Performance:* Terry emphasized the need for better performance in large forms and expressed interest in using core components and JSON submission to achieve this.\n    ◦ *Performance Issues:* Terry emphasized the poor performance of large forms created with foundational components and the need for better performance.\n    ◦ *Core Components:* Terry expressed interest in using core components and JSON submission to improve the performance of large forms.\n    ◦ *Lightweight Forms:* Terry highlighted the importance of creating lightweight forms with core components to ensure a faster and more efficient user experience.\n    ◦ *Performance Measurement:* Terry mentioned the need to measure the performance benefits of using core components and JSON submission for large forms.\n• *Review Component:* Terry highlighted the importance of the review component for their forms, and Sudhanshu confirmed that it will be available soon.\n    ◦ *Importance of Review Component:* Terry emphasized the critical need for a review component in their forms, which allows users to review their submissions before finalizing.\n    ◦ *Availability:* Sudhanshu confirmed that the review component will be available soon and provided details on its functionality, including the ability to review different panels and selectively choose components to review.\n• *Code Editor Challenges:* Ande raised concerns about the lack of a code editor for core component development, and Sudhanshu explained the rationale behind its removal and potential solutions.\n    ◦ *Concerns Raised:* Ande raised concerns about the lack of a code editor for core component development, which creates a strong dependency on the development team for writing custom functions.\n    ◦ *Rationale for Removal:* Sudhanshu explained that the code editor was removed to maintain a separation of phases and personas, with developers working in a Git repository for better source control and tracking changes.\n    ◦ *Potential Solutions:* Sudhanshu mentioned that on the cloud service, there is an option to store custom functions in a Git repository, which can be reviewed and made available in the visual rule editor without triggering a pipeline. He offered to check the feasibility of supporting this on the 6.5 setup.\n• *Table Component:* Ande and Sudhanshu discussed the need for a table component in core components, with Sudhanshu suggesting potential improvements and customer-driven development.\n    ◦ *Need for Table Component:* Ande highlighted the need for a table component in core components, which is currently available in foundational components but missing in core components.\n    ◦ *Potential Improvements:* Sudhanshu suggested potential improvements, such as using responsive layouts like accordions instead of tables for better mobile device compatibility.\n    ◦ *Customer-Driven Development:* Sudhanshu mentioned that the development of new components and improvements is customer-driven, and they are open to including critical requirements in their roadmap based on customer feedback.\n• *XML Schema Support:* Ande inquired about the support for XML schema in core components, and Sudhanshu confirmed that it is not currently supported and not in the immediate roadmap.\n    ◦ *Inquiry on XML Schema:* Ande inquired about the support for XML schema in core components, expressing the need to avoid the additional effort of maintaining both JSON and XML schemas.\n    ◦ *Current Support:* Sudhanshu confirmed that XML schema support is not currently available in core components and is not in the immediate roadmap.\n    ◦ *Future Plans:* Sudhanshu mentioned that they might revisit the requirement in the second half of the year if it becomes a critical requirement for customers.\n• *Migration Utility:* Sudhanshu shared links to the migration utility for converting foundation forms to core components and converting XFA forms to adaptive forms, and suggested a follow-up session for a demo.\n    ◦ *Shared Links:* Sudhanshu shared links to the migration utility for converting foundation forms to core components and converting XFA forms to adaptive forms.\n    ◦ *Follow-Up Session:* Sudhanshu suggested scheduling a follow-up session to demo the migration utility and provide further assistance with the conversion process _*(AFv1 to AFV2 and AFCS) -* cc:  <@U03BKR6K3R8>_ _<@U0213T59LMN>_ \n:todo_done: *Next Action*\n• *Migration Tool Demo:* Schedule a subsequent call to demo the migration tool and walk through the support available in the tool. (Sudhanshu)\n• *PPT Review:* Share the draft PPT with 7 slides and go through it during the meeting.

They wanted us to create a workflow model that would accurately implement the author’s decision-making process based on the submitted data.\n\nMeeting Notes:\nModel presentation: We demonstrated the custom workflow model  explaining the different pathways for approving, rejecting, or deferring the submitted form by showing how the workflow iterates through the list of approvers to assign it to different approvers.\n\nTheming: Cintas's team also inquired about the look and feel of the forms when moving to the cloud. We explained that the authoring UI would be modernized, but the form's appearance could be customized based on branding requirements. They also discussed the possibility of reusing existing themes.\n\nForm Migration and Maintenance: Their another ask was about the pros and cons of migrating forms to the cloud. It was explained that migrating forms would allow leveraging new capabilities like headless and generative UI, but there would be some manual effort required to recreate themes.\n\nDocument Storage and Management: They also enquired about the storage and management of attached documents on the cloud. It was explained that AEM forms do not persist any data, and the documents would need to be configured to go to the system of record. They also mentioned the possibility of using external data sources.\n\nForm Customisation: Finally, they asked about maintaining the same look and feel for forms used by executives. They were assured that the forms could be customised to match the existing appearance, but some manual effort would be required.\n:todo_done: *Next Action*\n• Model Validation: Cintas's representative in the meeting would share the Workflow model with other team members for validation and testing.\n• Form Look and Feel(on call): Vijay has already shared the published URL of an Adaptive Form built on Cloud using a custom theme to showcase the look and feel of forms on the cloud.\n• Their representative also suggested to schedule another call if they encounter any more concerns and questions.\n"

But most of these forms were Reader Extended and then filled/submitted offline or through email.\n• We want to evaluate GenAI based form conversion for some of their form. In the meeting we discussed evaluating their 433-A (OIC) form (shared with <@W4RU708G5> offline) to see if this would have a better conversion with AFCS.\n• We need to confirm if they need DoR - since that would require binding to XFA elements as well - FYI <@W4RU708G5>.\n• Will be creating an internal slack channel for IRS to speed up communication. Also, <@W011G64JM5W> would be evaluating the Gen AI based form conversion on his environment (will be sharing the program/environment details).\ncc: <@W4RSW3ECC> <@W5HEU5M7Y>\n:todo_done: *Next Action*\n"

Wells Fargo was not aware of this and wanted a demo of the issue and how we are planning to fix it. \n• The problem involves text boxes and text fields being read by screen readers even when the \"speak disable\" property is set to 1 in the template file.\n• We provided a demo of the issue and explained how to resolve it by making changes to the XCI and XDP files.\n• We walked through the process of marking a draw field in the template as an artifact, ensuring that \"speak disable\" is set to 1, preventing it from being read by the screen reader, and ensuring no tag is created.\n• We clarified the use of the \"taggingMode\" field in the XCI, which should be set to \"custom mode\" to make text fields uneditable, along with setting \"speak disable\" to 1.\n• The customer was satisfied with the solution, understanding that the issue can be fixed by updating the XCI and configuring the correct properties in Designer.\n• They expressed appreciation for the support we are providing in addressing accessibility issues in Designer and XMLFM.\n:todo_done: *Next Action*\n"
